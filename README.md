# C Programming

## C Programming: Getting Started - 1

- variable and declare, initialize and modify variables of data types int, double and char
- comment simple C-programs that may print text, special characters and variables to the screen with controlled formatting
- create simple C-programs that utilize for-loops to repeat blocks of instructions

## C Programming: Language Foundations - 2

- use logical conditions to control the flow of a program via branch statements (if-else), repetition (for/while loop) and nesting of these structures
- create and utilize arrays of integers and floating point numbers.
- use FOR and WHILE loop and create programs using them as nest branch statements.
- create arrays of characters (strings), use the null terminator, and manipulate strings to find their lengths.
- sort through arrays: alphabetizing strings, ordering numbers, finding specific numbers, etc.
