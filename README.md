# C Programming

## C Programming: Getting Started - 1

- variable and declare, initialize and modify variables of data types int, double and char
- comment simple C-programs that may print text, special characters and variables to the screen with controlled formatting
- create simple C-programs that utilize for-loops to repeat blocks of instructions

## C Programming: Language Foundations - 2

- use logical conditions to control the flow of a program via branch statements (if-else), repetition (for/while loop) and nesting of these structures
- create and utilize arrays of integers and floating point numbers.
- use FOR and WHILE loop and create programs using them as nest branch statements.
- create arrays of characters (strings), use the null terminator, and manipulate strings to find their lengths.
- sort through arrays: alphabetizing strings, ordering numbers, finding specific numbers, etc.

## C Programming: Modular Programming and Memory Management - 3

- Break a complex programming task into a number of functions to which you pass arguments
- Learn how computer memory is organized to store variables and arrays
- Find the address of a variable
- Perform simple pointer arithmetic

## C Programming: Pointers and Memory Management - 4

- Visualize the concept of a pointer and use it to pass variables to functions by reference in order to modify them via the function
- Apply pointer arithmetic in order to address elements of both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
- Use arrays of strings to store lists of strings in one array variable
- Control memory usage by dynamically allocating and freeing memory at runtime

## C Programming: Advanced Data Types - 5

- Define new data types (structures) to store multiple data items in one variable and create, initialize and modify variables of these new types
- Find and explain the memory usage of a structure and use pointers to structures
- Create linked lists of structures with dynamic memory allocation at runtime
- Sort or search lined lists of structures

## C Programming: Using Linux Tools and Libraries

- Use external libraries
- Build an application from multiple source files
- Automate the building process using makefiles
- Pass and use arguments to the main function. Read from and write to files in C
